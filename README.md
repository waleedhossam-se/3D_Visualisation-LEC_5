What is the project?

It is a solving for a lecture task for translating and rotating 3D cubes and even using the camera to zoom in & out the scene or rotating the scene.

How does someone develop, use, and test the code?

Use X KEY for rotating the cube around X-axis.

Use Y KEY for rotating the cube around Y-axis.

Use Z KEY for rotating the cube around Z-axis.

Use Right arrow for translating the cube right.

Use Left arrow for translating the cube left.

Use UP arrow for translating the cube up.

Use DOWN arrow for translating the cube down.

Use E KEY for Zooming-out of the scene by the use of the camera.

Use R KEY for Zooming-in to the scene by the use of the camera.

Use U KEY for rotating the camera around X-axis.

Use W KEY for rotating the camera around Y-axis.

Use V KEY for rotating the scene to UP-LEFT by the use of camera.

Use M KEY for rotating the scene to UP-RIGHT by the use of camera.

Use Space Key for the rotation of the cube around an edge.
